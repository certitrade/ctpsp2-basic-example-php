# ctpsp2-basic-example-php
PHP example of using the version 2 Basic API.

## Getting Started

A complete example on how to use the Basic API in PHP is available here: [https://github.com/certitrade/ctpsp2-basic-example-php]

To get started:

* [Download](https://github.com/certitrade/ctpsp2-basic-example-php/archive/master.zip) and unpack the files.
* Copy the `ctpsp2-basic-example` folder to the web root or another public folder on your server.
* Open `shop.php` from a web browser. Typically this is accomplished by appending `/ctpsp2-basic-example/example/shop.php` to the webshops address.

As soon as the package is placed in a webb folder a test purchase can be performed without any additional programming. The structure, code and comment clearly show how it can be adapted to any webshop system.
